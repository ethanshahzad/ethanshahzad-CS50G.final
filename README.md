My final project meets the requirements for distinctivness and complexity when compared to the projects I have completed throughout the course. My project is distinct because in
all of the cs50 games I have worked on not a single one was based on a rhythm game or music. Not a single concept in my final project relates to any of the projects I have done
for cs50 games. My final project meets the requirements for complexity because I used majority of the methods I have learned from this course to create a project that is complex 
but allows the user to code and add their own song in without that much effort. I also search up how to create certain visuals that I wanted to make with lua, which I didn't 
learn in the course, and implemented it into my game.
